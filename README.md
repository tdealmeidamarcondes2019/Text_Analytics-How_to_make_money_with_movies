# Text_Analytics | How to make money with movies

Academical project: collecting and analyzing text data with R.

This sentiment analysis's main objective is to further understand the movie's industry towards the content of the movies that generated higher revenue in the last decades. This way, it will be possible to check if the content changed over time, and what were the key sentiments these movies explored to become so attractive to the audience. 

To develop the analysis, it was selected the top 5 movies considering their worldwide grossing revenue in the past 4 decades (the 2010s, 2000s, 1990s, and 1980s).

To build the dataset, we researched and extracted the subtitles of these movies from online sources (source available in the final report file).

The repository has 4 files:

1. Movies_Assignment.xlsx: dataset with subtitles of the 5 movies with the highest revenue from the 2010s, 2000s, 1990s, and 1980s.

2. Movies_Revenue.R: R file with the detailed code.

3. R_code.pdf: R code in a PDF format including the output.

4. Final_report.pdf: a PDF file with the business insights extracted from the analysis.
